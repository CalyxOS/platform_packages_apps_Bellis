      "message": "If a concern is that it will cause provisioning steps to be re-run on every boot or profile start, meaning e.g. that initially-required system apps disabled by the user will be re-enabled, that looks to be true because the provisioningComplete method checks a shared preference that is apparently never actually set anywhere, unless I missed it, but that\u0027s just a bug that is easy to fix.\n\nThis change seems like a good potential solution, and it can also ensure that provisioning steps are retried on \"boot\" until successful, if they do not complete to the point that the process is marked as done... (although, if that\u0027s the case, the SetupWizard may not have everything it needs, e.g. Seedvault and microG, so it shouldn\u0027t ever happen anyway). In any case, I will try this change out today.",
