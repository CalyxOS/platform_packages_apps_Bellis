If the user doesn\u0027t complete that first work profile setup wizard, they can\u0027t ever create another work profile, and I don\u0027t know how they would recover from it. And this change doesn\u0027t fix it.\n\n@olivercscott@gmail.com I wonder if you\u0027d have any ideas. I\u0027m not looking forward to digging into this problem again, but I can if needed.",
