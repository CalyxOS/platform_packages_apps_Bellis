      "message": "As far as I can tell, that\u0027s because the Intent that started the Activity originally hasn\u0027t changed (that\u0027s what is returned by `getIntent()` or, in Kotlin, `intent`). Returning to the existing Activity from SUW doesn\u0027t change that fact; we\u0027re just going back to it. (Also, to be clear, when SUW is called twice, the PID/TID of Bellis is the same each time, so it\u0027s the same instance.)\n\nI\u0027m no expert in these kinds of details of Android apps. I came across this when I was trying to look it up / understand it: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34195828/how-to-come-back-to-first-activity-without-its-oncreate-called\n\n...and I did try some of the suggestions (singleTask launch mode in the manifest; using the particular flags mentioned), but it always ended up calling onCreate again anyway, so this was all I could think of.\n\nI added Aayush because I know he has experience on the app side of things in case we\u0027re missing something obvious.",
