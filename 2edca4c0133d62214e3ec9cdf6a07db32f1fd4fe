      "message": "Confirmed, lower-complexity cannot be chosen, PIN cannot be removed (at least not in an obvious way).\n\nIt also looks like, fortunately, if trying to turn off \"use one lock\" for the work profile, the work profile is subject to the complexity, too. This is a good thing due to the fact that work profile encryption is not at all tied to parent profile encryption under the hood, when not using one lock.",
