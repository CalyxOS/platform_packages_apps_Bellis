      "message": "This doesn\u0027t seem to accomplish the desired effect with `Orbot 17.0.0-RC-1-tor.0.4.7.11`. Orbot starts, yes, and the \"Connected to the Tor network\" notification shows, but it\u0027s not acting as a VPN. There is a \"Disconnected from always-on VPN\" notification, and trying to access the network fails; there is no usable connectivity.\n\nPerhaps we should separate out the Orbot-related stuff from this change.\n\nTested with https://review.calyxos.org/c/CalyxOS/platform_packages_apps_SetupWizard/+/14940/35 (chain) and https://review.calyxos.org/c/CalyxOS/platform_packages_apps_SetupWizard/+/14581/32",

      "message": "I suggest we just remove the Orbot-starting code. It can\u0027t work anymore, because Orbot no longer starts the VPN unless `Prefs.putUseVpn(true)` or equivalent is called, and this doesn\u0027t happen without UI interaction, in ConnectFragment.\n\nI uploaded a possible fix here for starting Orbot with always-on VPN here: https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot/pull/1041\n\nWith that, we won\u0027t need to try to start Orbot. It should just start when we set it as the always-on VPN.\n\nThis problem is tracked at the following issues:\n- Orbot: https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot/issues/1007 \n- CalyxOS: https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/calyxos/-/issues/1523",
