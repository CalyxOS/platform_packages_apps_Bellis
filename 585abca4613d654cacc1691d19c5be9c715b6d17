      "message": "This doesn\u0027t seem to accomplish the desired effect with `Orbot 17.0.0-RC-1-tor.0.4.7.11`. Orbot starts, yes, and the \"Connected to the Tor network\" notification shows, but it\u0027s not acting as a VPN. There is a \"Disconnected from always-on VPN\" notification, and trying to access the network fails; there is no usable connectivity.\n\nPerhaps we should separate out the Orbot-related stuff from this change.\n\nTested with https://review.calyxos.org/c/CalyxOS/platform_packages_apps_SetupWizard/+/14940/35 (chain) and https://review.calyxos.org/c/CalyxOS/platform_packages_apps_SetupWizard/+/14581/32",
