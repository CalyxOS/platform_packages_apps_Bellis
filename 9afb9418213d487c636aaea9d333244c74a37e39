      "message": "Agree; the reason for the pref is that it was an easy way to be sure that the particular profile is the Safer/Safest profile, instead of a profile added later (multiple profiles), without assuming Safer/Safest is the first profile found or something, which might not be guaranteed to be true forever. But it looks like we may want/need something more robust than that.",
