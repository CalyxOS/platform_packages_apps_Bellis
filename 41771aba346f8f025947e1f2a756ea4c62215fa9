      "message": "We should probably have a better way to safely determine the garlic level, as opposed to storing it in shared preferences.\n\nWhy? Here\u0027s a possible problem: User sets up device in Safest. User reaches the work profile setup wizard. User restores data. Data for Bellis is restored. garlicLevel is replaced with a past value. Safest profile would then be removable, since this is the only thing stopping it.\n\nRelated: https://review.calyxos.org/c/CalyxOS/platform_packages_apps_Bellis/+/17659",
