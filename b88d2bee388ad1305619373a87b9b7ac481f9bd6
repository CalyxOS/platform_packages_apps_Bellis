      "message": "Since these are exported, I think we should guard them behind a permission to prevent unauthorized callers from causing mischief, like [TestDPC](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testdpc/blob/8b83e20f71da3e478444e47ba0b35946ec981520/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L102) does. Looks like the permission applies to the whole activity, though...? It uses a separate activity, and permission `BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN` to protect `ADMIN_POLICY_COMPLIANCE` and `GET_PROVISIONING_MODE`. (It doesn\u0027t for `PROVISIONING_SUCCESSFUL`, which is yet a different activity, but maybe we can/should for that, too?)",
