Looks like the permission applies to the whole activity, though...? It uses a separate activity, and permission `BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN` to protect `ADMIN_POLICY_COMPLIANCE` and `GET_PROVISIONING_MODE`. (It doesn\u0027t for `PROVISIONING_SUCCESSFUL`, which is yet a different activity, but maybe we can/should for that, too?)",
