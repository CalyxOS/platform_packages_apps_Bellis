The \"wipe after 3 failed attempts\" makes Safest virtually unusable for many parents, for example, and the requirement of strong auth after 1 hour could be problematic for people in public / in view of cameras.\n\nSorry if I\u0027ve said this before, I feel like I made these exact comments somewhere else a long time ago.",
